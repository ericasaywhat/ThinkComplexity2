In this paper, the authors prove that wars are self-organized in the same way the forest fire model. They find there is a fractal dependence of number on intensity in which intensity is measured in terms of battle deaths. They extend the ignition of fire to the outbreak for as well as its spread. The "avalanches" in this paper are the eruptions of war that they say follow a fractal frequency-size distribution. They prove that it is reasonable to associate the number of battle deaths in a war with the number of trees that burn in a forest fire. For a war to begin, one country might invade another,  or a politician might be assassinated, the war then spreads over nearby regions of metastable countries. Such clusters could simulate the countries of the Middle East. Though some may argue that the introduction of weapons of mass destruction change the interactions of the world but they claim that the same can be claimed of our human interventions that should have affected the distribution forest fires. For the forest fire model to remain valid, the authors of this article claim that their war model must also then be accurate.
