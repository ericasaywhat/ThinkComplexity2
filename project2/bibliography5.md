This paper investigates the containment strategy for smallpox as a bioterror since routine vaccinations for smallpox stopped in 1972. Smallpox is very transmissable and has a death rate of about 30% in which 30% of infected individuals die. Their model explicitly includes hospitals and tracks the progression of the disease in each individual. They assume that each town holds 100 households, with two adults and two children, one school, one workplace, and one morgue. When one person comes into contact with an infected individual, they also become infected. Fifteen days after contact, the smallpox rash develops. They found that a proper pre-emptive measure is to have all hospital workers vaccinated and voluntary revaccination of healthy vaccines (those who were successfully vaccinated in the past). If there were to be a bioterrorist attack using smallpox, there should be an isolation of confirmed cases in hospitals and vaccination of household members of confirmed cases. With this, 100% of the simulated outbreaks result in less than 21 deaths.
