In this article, the authors want to prove that randomly structured and panmictic populations, populations in which there is random mating in a breeding population, have the same growth behaviour. The paper itself makes two points: 1) panmictic and random graphs have the same growth behaviour, and 2) in examining networks that are neither random nor regular, specifically Watts-Strogatz and Barabasi-Albert models, they found that they can accurately model panmictic populations. Moreover the inhomogeneity of these networks allows opens up new possibilities to evolutionary computation.
