**Moore, Cristopher, and Mark EJ Newman. "Epidemics and percolation in small-world networks." Physical Review E 61.5 (2000): 5678.**

In this article, Moore and Newman make the claim that since the degrees of separation in a network is small compared to the netowrk itself, disease percolation also is much faster than one would expect. In other words, with Milgram's six degrees of separation, a highly infectious disease would be able to spread to all the people on the planet in just six incubation periods of the disease. They incorporate the two parameters of interest when talking about diseases into their networks: susceptibility and transmissibility. They conclude that their results provide simple models to simulate the onset of epidemic behaviour in desieases for which either susceptibility or transmissibility are less than 100%.
