Opsahl, Tore, and Pietro Panzarasa. "Clustering in weighted networks." Social networks 31.2 (2009): 155-163.

In this article, Opsahl and Panzarasa are investigating weighted graphs. They are investigating the clustering of weighted networks and whether clustering is an inherent characteristic of such graphs. By analyzing these weighted networks and focusing on the global clustering coefficient, they attempt to come up with a generalization about the behaviour of clusters that explicitly takes into consideration the weights on the edges. They suggest that using the generalized clustering coefficient (for the weighted networks) actually yields more information than just using localized or global ones that don't regard the weights on the graph.
